2. **Go Deep**: Focus on high-impact areas identified in broad analysis
3. **Cross-Reference**: Validate findings across multiple tools and perspectives
4. **Synthesize**: Combine insights into actionable intelligence

### **Concise First Approach**
- Use default parameters initially for broad understanding
- Drill down with detailed analysis only where specific insights are needed
- Focus on actionable opportunities rather than exhaustive data dumps

### **Context Building**
- Each phase builds on previous discoveries
- Use findings from earlier phases to guide later analysis
- Cross-reference insights across different tools for validation
